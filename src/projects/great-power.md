...comes great responsibility.

this [firefox browser extension](https://github.com/ivywong/great-power) lets you rearrange website elements to your liking by dragging them around.

google's homepage too clean and minimalist for you? fix it yourself!

<img src="/img/great-power-google.png" alt="google homepage but 'better' (elements all askew)">

not enough time to scroll through all of Mozilla's documentation? read it all at the same time!

<img src="/img/great-power-mdn.png" alt="MDN docs on drag and drop, but the first paragraphs are all overlaid on top of each other">

beware, these changes will stick around even after you reload. (but that's obviously a good thing)
