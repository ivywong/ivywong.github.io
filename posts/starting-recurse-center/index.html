<p>I just finished my first week at <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a>, a self-directed community-focused programmer's retreat, which started on January 3rd. I'd found out about RC sometime in 2022<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>, and thought it was Very Cool, both in its values and goals, and in the idea of being able to spend a whole 12 weeks with other people learning and hacking on various things. But I didn't think I would have 6 to 12 weeks of vacation or free time any time soon, so I put it on my mental bucket list.</p>
<p>Then I quit my job last year<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> to take a break and figure out where I wanted my career to go next, and found myself staring down at a lot of free time. After some traveling, I applied to Recurse Center in December. Fortunately, I was just able to squeak by into the Winter 2 batch.</p>
<p>The first week (which was more like half a week) was very hectic and jam packed with events, chatting with people, and reading way too much Zulip. I RSVP'd for far too many study groups<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> than I had time for and spent some time this weekend figuring out which ones I could actually feasibly attend.</p>
<p>In any case, now that things have calmed down a bit, let's talk about goals.</p>
<div class="anchor-wrapper">
<h2 id="initial-goals" tabindex="-1">Initial Goals</h2>
<a class="header-anchor" href="#initial-goals" class="test"><span class="visually-hidden">permalink to &quot;Initial Goals&quot;</span> <span aria-hidden="true">#</span></a></div>
<p>Coming into Recurse Center I had a couple of vague goals, but didn't have a big project I wanted to focus on specifically. The goals that I put down in my intro were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>building some small webapps to learn Javascript/Typescript, possibly related to language learning, or just some fun/cool art or data visualization</li>
<li>make my own personal website and blog following IndieWeb standards, and actually write some blog posts<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup></li>
<li>dipping into gamedev with Godot, or experimenting with interactive fiction</li>
<li>learning about LLMs/generative AI/NLP</li>
<li>going out of my comfort zone with topics such as low-level or systems programming, and programming language theory</li>
<li>meet new people and pair program a lot!</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't expect to work on all of these, of course. In fact, after this first week and thinking about how I'm going to manage my time, I think my actual goals for the first few weeks should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>building some small fun webapps to learn Javascript/Typescript/webdev</li>
<li>meet new people and pair program a lot!</li>
<li>blog about what I'm learning</li>
<li>dabble with other topics in my free time or when I am bored/stuck</li>
</ul>
<p>Tomorrow, there's going to be a workshop on &quot;building your volitional muscles&quot; which might also help with goal-setting. I'm excited for week 2!</p>
